Models: User, Trip, TripMember, Message, Friendship

1. Each user can add multiple friends, and that friend can add multiple friends, including the user. This forms a self-referncing
many to many relationship between User and Friendship.

2. Each user can register / organize many trips, and each trip can have many trip members (users). This forms a many to many relationship
between User and Trip. But since the I want the joined table to have extra fields, I need a seperate model called TripMember for that.

3. Each user can have many hobbies, and each hobby tag can belong to many users. This forms another classic many to many relationship
between User and Hobby. But since this joined table does not need any extra fields, and .NET auto handles and generates a seperate
joined model behind the scene, so no joined model needs to be created explicitly. 

4. Each user can send many messages, but each message can only belong to one user. Thus, the relationship from User to Message is one
to many, the relationship from Message to User is many to one.
